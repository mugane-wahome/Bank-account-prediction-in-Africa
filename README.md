Financial inclusion remains a significant challenge hindering economic and human development in Africa, with only 14% of adults in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda having access to commercial bank accounts. Despite the emergence of mobile money and innovative fintech solutions, banks continue to play a crucial role in providing financial services. This project's objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts individuals' likelihood of having or using a bank account. This model will offer insights into the current state of financial inclusion and shed light on key factors influencing individuals' financial security, contributing to efforts aimed at fostering long-term economic growth in the region.
